In this project, I conducted an in-depth exploratory data analysis on the Black Friday dataset to uncover insights into customer demographics and purchasing behavior. Using Pandas for data manipulation and Seaborn for visualization, I analyzed key attributes such as gender, age, marital status, and city category to understand their impact on purchasing patterns. Various visualizations, including pie charts, bar plots, and count plots, were generated to reveal trends in customer behavior. The analysis highlighted significant differences in spending across different demographic groups, providing insights that could be leveraged for targeted marketing strategies. Additionally, the exploration of product categories and customer segmentation offered valuable information for optimizing product offerings and enhancing customer satisfaction.
